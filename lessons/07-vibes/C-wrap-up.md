  Congrats on completing Complete Intro to MCP by Brian Holt. This wrap-up
  outlines practical next steps: build or open-source MCP servers for your apps,
  explore MCP client workflows and tools across IDEs, and experiment with new
  MCP servers and clients to unlock greater AI-agent productivity. Share your
  learnings on social to celebrate your growth.

Congrats! You finished the course!

I hope you learned a lot! I certainly did in the creation of the course. I hope you walked away with a comfort working with agents and chatbots and how to give them tools, resources, and prompts to get out of them what you want. I hope you learned a few tips and tricks from me that I've learned over the past year or so working a lot with LLMs.

So what should you do now?

- If you just vibe coded an app with me in the previous section, make an MCP server for it and then use that with your coding LLM
- If you're more keen on learning to make MCP servers, go find cool stuff to make MCP servers for.
  - If you have a service that you like that doesn't have an MCP server, go make one and open source it!
  - I had fun making a personal MCP server that I use with Claude. It can read and write to my calendar, email, local file system, Discord, messaging apps, etc. and then I can use Claude to ask questions about myself!
- If you're more keen on the LLM client side
  - Go vibe code some more apps! This is a learned skill and it's one you'll get a lot of experience in by just doing it.
  - Try a few of the various IDEs. I was pretty hard stuck in the VS Code agent experience but once I got into Claude Code it just fit my mental model so well. Go try them all!
  - Go try [more of the best MCP servers][awesome] and see what other cool productivity unlocks are awaiting you.
- [Go try one of the clients][clients] that supports the newer features like elicitation or sampling. Really get your head arounds what's coming.

I hope you enjoyed the course and please tweet / post on LinkedIn what you learned and what you built! It makes me so stoked to see you grow!
