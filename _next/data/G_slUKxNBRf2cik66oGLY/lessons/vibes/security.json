{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"description":"Brian Holt emphasizes security as the top priority when using AI agents and MCP servers, urging you to vet and remove unreliable MCPs and to verify any that you employ. He introduces the Paperclip Golden Retriever as a cautionary reminder that agents will aggressively pursue prompts, so craft precise prompts and thoroughly validate outputs. This guidance helps you safely build AI tools with the Model Context Protocol and the MCP framework.","keywords":["mcp security","ai agents safety","model context protocol","paperclip maximizer","paperclip golden retriever","prompt engineering safety","Brian Holt"]},"html":"<p>I&#39;ve talked about this a lot throughout the course, and I just want to drive home in its own section that security should be top of mind for you while working with agents and MCP servers.</p>\n<h2>Malicious or Bad MCP Servers</h2>\n<p>Not all MCP servers are created equal.</p>\n<p>Some are just bad - they&#39;re thin wrappers on APIs or do things that LLMs already do well themselves.
