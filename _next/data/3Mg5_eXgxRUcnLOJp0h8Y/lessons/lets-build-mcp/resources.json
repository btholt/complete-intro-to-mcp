{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"description":"Brian Holt explains Resources in MCP, showing how they differ from tools by providing static, non-dynamic context to an LLM. The guide walks through creating an MCP server and a static resource (database-schema) with code, attaching it in Claude Desktop, and querying the LLM to explain the schema in plain English. It also covers resource templates, their limitations, and practical steps for using Resources in an MCP project like an issue tracker.","keywords":["mcp","model context protocol","resources","mcp server","database schema","brian holt"]},"html":"<p>We&#39;ve been working with tools so far, let&#39;s go on to resources.</p>\n<p>Resources are a bit different than tools.
