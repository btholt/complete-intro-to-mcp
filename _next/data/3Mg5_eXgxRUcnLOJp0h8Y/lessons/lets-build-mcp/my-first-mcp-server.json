It runs a locally running server that allows you to feed it information via [standard IO][stdio] an LLM can call. In truth, MCP servers are at their core super simple, and you'll probably think it's silly that we wrap them in such a mystique (it is silly.)\n\nIt's a bit of a specialized server as it expects certain input to return certain shapes of responses, but beyond that it's a bog-standard server, so much so that you can literally write your MCP servers in plain Node.js/Bun/Python/whatever.\n\nWe'll be using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` which is a little toolkit that helps you get started. It's not totally necessary as the MCP protocol is fairly simple but it just helps us make sure that everything gets tracked the right way.\n\nSo create a new directory, do `npm init -y` and run `npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. In a new file called mcp.js, add\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n  McpServer,\n  ResourceTemplate,\n} from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js\";\nimport { StdioServerTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js\";\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\n\n// Create an MCP server\nconst server = new McpServer({\n  name: \"add-server\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n});\n\n// Add an addition tool\nserver.registerTool(\n  \"add\",\n  {\n    title: \"Addition Tool\",\n    description: \"Add two numbers\",\n    inputSchema: { a: z.number(), b: z.number() },\n  },\n  async ({ a, b }) => {\n    return {\n        content: [{ type: \"text\", text: String(a + b) }],\n    }\n);\n\n// Start receiving messages on stdin and sending messages on stdout\nconst transport = new StdioServerTransport();\nawait server.connect(transport);\n```\n\n- This is as simple an MCP server as you're going to find.\n- It registers itself as an MCP server with the `new McpServer` instantiation\n- We then add one tool to it, one that adds two numbers together.

LLMs do well with strong guidelines\n  - It's documentation for future you of what this tool call needs.\n  - It also allows you to add annotations that tell the LLM \"this variable named X expects Y type and in plain English, this variable is Z.\"\n\nSo try starting your server and you'll see it'll just do nothing.
